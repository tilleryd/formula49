I bought a Puch Magnum a couple years ago with a completely roached out engine. I don't know how so much moisture got into the engine but the piston rings were rusted to the cylinder and the crankshaft resembeled an artifact from the Titanic. I swapped over the 2hp engine from my Puch Maxi so I could ride but I wanted to get the original engine running again. So this winter, it's time a rebuild.
