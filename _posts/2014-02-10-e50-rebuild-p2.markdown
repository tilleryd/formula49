I wish I took more pictures of the engine tear down process. All I have is a picture of a pile of parts. Get yourself a manual or watch this video - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HhAreElS3I" target="_blank" class="callout">1979 Puch Magnum Project Part 6 - E50 bottom end rebuild</a>.  I basically followed this guy's rebuild to a T.
