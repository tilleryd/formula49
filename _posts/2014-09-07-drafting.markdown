One of the great things about 49cc bikes is that you reach top speed on public roads.  At least I do.  I've hit 49mph down hill but for the most part I'm averaging 43 - 45mph.  Sometimes you ride with a buddy who is just a bit faster.  If you get within 3 to 4 ft behind him you can draft him.  The slipstream will give you a couple extra mph and you can pull up next to or pass him.  People will stare at you but that's because you look awesome doing it.
